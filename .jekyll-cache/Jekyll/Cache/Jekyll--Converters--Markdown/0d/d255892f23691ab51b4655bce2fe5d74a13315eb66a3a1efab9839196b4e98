I"Q<h1 id="welcome-to-the-site">Welcome to the Site</h1>
<p>My name is <strong>Sebastian Southwell</strong>, and I am currently a Second-Year Computer Science student at the <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/">University of Sheffield</a> working towards an MComp (<em>Masters Of Computing</em>) with Yr In Industry. I have already been learning Computer Science for at least 5 years now and have made a variety of projects in my spare time such as Chatrooms, Revision Monitors and a fully functional <a href="http://anyqueue.sebasouthwell.co.uk">Spotify Controller System</a>.</p>

<p>This website was built as a portfolio to display my extra-curricular work, if you have any questions or queries regarding any of projects, please feel free to contact me using the links in the footer below.</p>

<h2 id="info-about-me">Info about me</h2>

<p>I am a decently competent programmer, and the reason I have mainly gained this ability is due to my extensive amount of practise with my mini-projects, where I constantly test the boundaries of my ability, as I believe that even if I have pushed myself a little bit each day, I will have also learnt something new each day. These skills of constant practise 24/7 for developers are especially required in this day and age due to all the new frameworks, libraries and technologies being created all the time changing the field bit by bit.</p>
