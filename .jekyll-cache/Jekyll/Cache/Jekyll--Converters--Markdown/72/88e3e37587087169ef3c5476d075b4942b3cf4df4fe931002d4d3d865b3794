<p>My name is <strong>Sebastian Southwell</strong>, and I am currently a Second-Year Computer Science student at the <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/">University of Sheffield</a> working towards an MComp (<em>Masters Of Computing</em>) with Yr In Industry whilst also being the Inclusions Officer of <a href="https://shefesh.com/">Sheffield Ethical Student Hackers Society</a>.</p>

<p>I have already been learning Computer Science for at least 5 years now and have made a variety of projects in my spare time such as Chatrooms, Revision Monitors and a fully functional <a href="http://anyqueue.sebasouthwell.co.uk">Spotify Controller System</a>.</p>

<p>This website was built as a portfolio to display my extra-curricular work, if you have any questions or queries regarding any of projects, please feel free to contact me using the links in the footer below.</p>
