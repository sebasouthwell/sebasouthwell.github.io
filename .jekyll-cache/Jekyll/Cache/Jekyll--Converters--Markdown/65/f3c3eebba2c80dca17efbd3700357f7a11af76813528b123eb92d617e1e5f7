        <h3>The AnyQueue Music System (Completed)</h3>
        <p>
        The AnyQueue project, took me about 2 weeks maximum to put together. This version of system was built in Ruby / Sinatra using the Spotify API and was my second time doing full stack development for a big project. The AnyQueue Music System allowed for the creation of rooms for Spotify Premium users, where they would then get a room code and be able to share it to others. In the rooms people have their own nicknames and can add songs to the room owner's spotify queue via a custom search menu, a list of all user added songs is then visible in the main page. 
        <br />
        <br />
        I originally built a much smaller version of this project about a month prior in C# which only allowed people to add my spotify queue, however realizing the possiblity for expansion I switched to Ruby due to my familiarity with the platform for full stack database management. The server itself is hosted on AWS and is currently in Spotify Development mode as I haven't flagged it for public release yet, meaning that only me and certain beta-testers can actually make accounts, apart from that though the system is finished.
