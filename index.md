# Welcome to the Site
My name is **Sebastian Southwell**, and I am currently a Second-Year Computer Science student at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/) working towards an MComp (*Masters Of Computing*) with Yr In Industry. I have already been learning Computer Science for at least 5 years now and have made a variety of projects in my spare time such as Chatrooms, Revision Monitors and a fully functional [Spotify Controller System](http://anyqueue.sebasouthwell.co.uk).

This website was built as a portfolio to display my extra-curricular work, if you have any questions or queries regarding any of projects, please feel free to contact me using the links in the footer below.
